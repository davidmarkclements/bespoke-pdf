# bespoke-pdf

PDF Routing for [Bespoke.js](https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke.js)

## Notes

* bespoke-pdf is simultaneously a bespoke plugin, and a gulp task
* the gulp-task is dependant plugin inclusion
* Check out example/gulpfile.js.diff and example/package.json.diff to see the changes that would be made a bespoke project (as generated by generator-bespoke)
* See example/dist/presentation-hello-world.pdf for generated pdf
* bespoke-pdf is currently incompatible with bespoke-bullet

## Todo

1) include a slide skipping mechanism
2) add a `generating-pdf` class to html element, to allow for custom stylings for PDF purposes (similar to `@media(print)`)
3) what if hidden slides we're automatically skipped? that would cover 1 with 2

## Bespoke Plugin

### Download

Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max], or use a [package manager](#package-managers).

[min]: https://raw.github.com/davidmarkclements/bespoke-pdf/master/dist/bespoke-pdf.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/davidmarkclements/bespoke-pdf/master/dist/bespoke-pdf.js

### Usage

This plugin is shipped in a [UMD format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), meaning that it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  pdf = require('bespoke-pdf');

bespoke.from('article', [
  pdf()
]);
```

When using browser globals:

```js
bespoke.from('article', [
  bespoke.plugins.pdf()
]);
```

### Package managers

#### npm

```bash
$ npm install bespoke-pdf
```

#### Bower

```bash
$ bower install bespoke-pdf
```

## Gulp Task

Once the bespoke-pdf has been included in a 
presentation, it can be integrated into a gulpfile.

For this part, bespoke-pdf *must* be installed via
npm.

```js
var pkg = require('./package.json'),
  pdf = require('bespoke-pdf'),
  rimraf = require('gulp-rimraf');

gulp.task('pdf', ['connect'], function () { 
  return pdf(pkg.name + '.pdf')
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});

gulp.task('clean:pdf', function() {
  return gulp.src('dist/' + pkg.name + '.pdf')
    .pipe(rimraf());
});
```
